This book marks the ending of my journey as a Ph.D. student with the Algorithmics research group of TU Delft. 
As an experience, it has been rather gratifying and rewarding but also very challenging at times. 
This book would not exist without the substantial support of my supervisors, 
which I have been receiving ever since I started working with them, initially as a MSc student.
Cees Witteveen, Tomas Klos, and Bob Huisman, 
thank you for giving me the opportunity to grow both as a scientist and a person under your supervision.

In turn, I would like to thank my family and my Sophie for their support and 
guidance that enabled me to maintain faith during the more challenging periods of this journey. 
In addition, I would like to thank Tim and Gleb for their friendship and support
and for long insightful discussions over various topics.
I am also grateful to my colleagues in the Algorithmics group for the ‘gezelligheid’ during lunch.
Finally, I am thankful to my predecessor, Michel, 
whose name is often cited in this book since his work set the foundation for many of the results presented here.

With a combination of pride and other feelings, 
I welcome the transition to a new phase of my life and I’m looking forward to whatever lies ahead.
