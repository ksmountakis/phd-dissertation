	\begin{abstract}
	
	This paper addresses a problem of practical value in project scheduling:
	trading expected makespan for stability,
	under stochastic activity duration uncertainty.
	We present the formal statement of a problem 
	that we name Proactive Stochastic RCPSP (PS-RCPSP).
	Assuming activity durations follow known probability distributions,
	PS-RCPSP asks to find a so-called earliest-start (es) policy and
	a proactive schedule that together minimize the weighted 
	sum of expected project makespan and expected instability
	(deviation of the realized from the proactive schedule).
	Extending an existing MILP model for the well-known deterministic 
	Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP),
	we present a MILP model for PS-RCPSP, which allows us to 
	find optimal (es-policy, proactive schedule) pairs.
	To deal with instances of practical size,
	we propose a Linear Programming (LP)-based 
	and a Mixed-Integer LP (MILP)-based heuristic.
	Our LP-based heuristic optimizes the proactive schedule while 
	keeping the es-policy part of the solution fixed.
	Our MILP-based heuristic aims to optimize the structure of the policy together with the proactive schedule.
	In contrast to existing state-of-art approaches such as
	CCP \cite{lamas2014purely} and STC \cite{van2008proactive},
	our heuristics rely on optimizing the proactive schedule together with the scheduling policy.
 	Experiments show that the LP-based heuristic is efficient and compares favorably with the state-of-art 
	(i.e.\ achieves smaller expected makespan for a certain level of expected instability)
	when the aim is to achieve near-zero instability at the cost of higher makespan.
	The MILP-based heuristic seems more effective (albeit not as efficient) when the aim is to
	achieve low expected makespan at the cost of moderate or high instability.
